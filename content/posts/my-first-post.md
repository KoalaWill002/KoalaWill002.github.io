<br />

## How to use it....
 * [X] Just call the exe file in the build folder.
 If you meet dll problems....I think you can fix it on your own
 
<br />

## How to change it....
 1. Fork it, or download it(of course)
 2. run
    ```
    cmake CmakeLists.txt
    ```
 3.
    if it mentions error about the file directory, delete the catche file and run the command above again
 4. 
    build it or press "F7"
 5. got to the build folder
 6. run it. ( I mean, it is quite obvious )
